    <h2>Travel is one of my biggest passions!!</h2>
    <p>I have been always curious to explore the world, parts of it that I have seen only in movies, documentaries or read in books.<br>
    This desire to travel came to me since when I was very young, in middle school and it still continous.
    I never missed a school excursion <br>since when I was in middle school or a family trip, and as I grew older 
    I started planning the trips myself with other friends and/or my sister. <br></p>
    <p>I look forward to travel more and visit new places, and here are some of the reasons why I love traveling so much: 
    <ul>
     1.To get inspired<br>
     2.To challenge myself<br>
     3.To feel more alive<br>
     4.To make new friends around the world<br>
     5.To see life from different perspectives<br>
     6.To try different food and experience different cultures<br>
     7.To take breathtaking pictures<br>
     8.To live out my bucket list dreams<br>
    </ul>
